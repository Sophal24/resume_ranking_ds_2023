It’s a place that breathes in time with nature, built from local materials, by local hands, and infused with local art and soul. An evolved tropical getaway with a pristine private beach, spacious wooden villas, heavenly spa sanctuaries and a preserved coral reef, Song Saa Private Island lets you detach from the world and tune into simple luxuries.

Built with reclaimed timber and materials from the mainland, the resort’s design and architecture reiterates our commitment to sustainability. Each villa is a private sanctuary, a refined blend of thatched roofs, linen-draped canopy beds, up-cycled décor and repurposed furniture. Discarded oil drums find new life as lamps. Driftwood serves as a table or bench.

","About Smiling Gecko Cambodia:
In 2014, Smiling Gecko Cambodia (SGC) was officially registered as a local NGO in Cambodia. SGC is legally independent of Smiling Gecko Switzerland. Following its mission of «Cambodians help Cambodians», the organization provides direct aid to disadvantaged people in the country, supporting local job initiatives and promoting self-help among the rural population. Apart from providing direct aid and supporting other NGOs, Smiling Gecko, thus, focuses on fighting the causes of poverty and helping people to help themselves. To this end, SGC launched a project on a previously acquired site to the North of Phnom Penh whose objective is to provide several thousand Cambodians with future job training and a regular income in the sectors of agriculture, tourism, industry, and trade. In future, the proceeds are intended to cover the operating costs of the innovative pilot school, which is also part of the cluster and provides education to nearly 1,000 children (from preschool to senior high school).",Publish Date：Nov-18-2022,Closing Date：Dec-18-2022,"Contact Information HR Department    recruitment@smilinggecko-cambodia.org  Srae Sar village, Tbaeng Khpos commune, Samakki Meanchey district, Kompong Chhnang province, Cambodia.

It is a private commercial bank and has been providing customers with safe and reliable banking services for 40 years. 

The Bank was created following Sub-decree No. 1213 dated 10 October 1979 under the former regime of the State of Cambodia. In 2000, the Bank was          separated from the direct management of the National Bank of Cambodia (""the Central Bank"") in order to transform its permanent identity into a state-owned commercial bank in Cambodia with the features of a Public Economic Enterprise and with the intention of conducting autonomous business              operations. 

In January 2001, the Bank obtained its banking license from the Central Bank to operate as a commercial bank in the Kingdom of Cambodia for a period of      three years starting from 4 January 2001. This was the first license granted to enable the Bank to operate as a separate legal entity independent from the Central Bank's direct management. On 8 January 2004, the Bank obtained its 2nd banking license from the Central Bank for a period of three years starting    from that date. The Bank now holds a commercial banking license, which was renewed for an indefinite period, on 21 December 2006

On 31 December 2002, the Ministry of Economy and Finance (""MEF"") announced, through a Statement of Intent, the privatisation of the Bank as part of the   reform of the financial sector of the Royal Government of Cambodia. On 28 October 2005 the shareholders of the Bank, represented by the Privatisation   Committee, entered into a sales agreement with Canadia Bank and ING Holding Company. The Central Bank sold its 20% shareholding in the Bank and MEF   reduced its 80% shareholding to 10%. In 2009, in accordance with the recommendation of the Central Bank, Canadia Bank reduced its shares from 48% to  15.22% and 2 new private shareholders having respectively a share of 15.39%, entered the capital of FTB.

Cellcard launched in 1997 in a joint venture with Millicom International Cellular providing its customers with the first prepaid service with scratchcards.

What followed for Cellcard was a number of firsts in the market such as introducing SMS, Value-Added Services, a dedicated Loyalty program, roaming services and a credit sharing platform.

Cellcard is Cambodia’s most-awarded mobile network having achieved more than 30 industry awards for network excellence including an impressive six consecutive Ookla Speedtest awards and a number of category wins from Opensignal including Best Games Experience in February 2020.

It’s most recent market firsts include the Cellcard Network Guarantee launched in 2017 reimbursing any customer who experiences a dropped call, the award-winning App-based Super Data Race held each year since 2017 and its move to lead the esports agenda in 2018 followed in 2019 with Cambodia’s first virtual gamer platform PlayGame and the first tailormade gamer data plan PlayGame Unlimited.

In February 2021, Cellcard revealed its latest innovation, the Pouk Mak chat app, the world’s first major Khmer languaged messaging App.

A major focus for Cellcard now is its evolution to 5G for consumers and enterprise, including Smart City applications across Fintech and web security, data privacy, public safety and security, environment protection, education, healthcare and e-government.

In terms of 5G network readiness, Cellcard has conducted numerous live tests on its stand-alone site reaching speeds of 1.8 gigabytes per second. These are Cambodia’s first and only tests conducted on a real end-to-end with 5G radio to a 5G core network able to accommodate network slicing for dedicated use cases.

TADA, another subsidiary, provides ride-hailing services mainly in Singapore, Cambodia and Vietnam and is building a mobility ecosystem by improving the profit structure of drivers through a new model that is completely different from existing companies.ONiON Mobility is actively conducting business in Cambodia by launching the T1, an eco-friendly version of the three-wheeled passenger vehicle “Tuk-Tuk”. We have established an EV factory to mass-produce our T1’s, and are operating electric vehicle charging stations all over the city of Phnom Penh. In addition to expanding our business throughout Cambodia, we are expanding our business to overseas regions by diversifying our product lineup, including the T1c for eco-friendly cargo transportation and eco-friendly bikes. In particular, the T1 provides a mileage of more than 100km and is an eco-friendly vehicle that does not have the inconvenience of long charging times by adopting a battery exchange method instead. ONiON has gained popularity in the local market by reducing maintenance costs of our E Tuk-Tuk’s by about 40% of the normal internal combustion vehicles because there is no need of frequent replacement of parts and high oil price. In addition, ONiON Mobility plans to collect and utilize all data generated from vehicles and stations for efficient operation and management at the MVL group level as well as to share the benefits to all the participants in the ecosystem created by MVL.",Publish Date：Nov-23-2022,Closing Date：Dec-23-2022,"Contact Information HR  010 656 242 sokhim.pek@onionev.com Phnom Penh HQ: , #93B, St590, Vllage13, Sangkat Boeng kok, Toul Kork, Phnom Penh, Cambodia. 010 656 242"

","With more than a dozen years of experience in hospitality, Madam Soklim opened her first restaurant, named Eleven One Kitchen after her lucky numbers. Offering both Khmer favorites as well as Western specials, her passion is to prepare delicious homemade food using local produce and without MSG.

Her first restaurant set in Toul Tompong area, features a spacious outdoor patio with luscious plants as well as an air-conditioned space. With the enormous success of the first restaurant, the owner opened a second in BKK1.  Set in a lush garden it feels like a small oasis in Phnom Penh’s concrete jungle. A fountain and abundant vegetation welcome the guests as they walk through to the cozy, yet spacious wooden terrace under natural bamboo shade.
