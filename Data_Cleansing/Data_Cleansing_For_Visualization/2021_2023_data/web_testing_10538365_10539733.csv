In 2014, Smiling Gecko Cambodia (SGC) was officially registered as a local NGO in Cambodia. SGC is legally independent of Smiling Gecko Switzerland. Following its mission of «Cambodians help Cambodians», the organization provides direct aid to disadvantaged people in the country, supporting local job initiatives and promoting self-help among the rural population. Apart from providing direct aid and supporting other NGOs, Smiling Gecko, thus, focuses on fighting the causes of poverty and helping people to help themselves. To this end, SGC launched a project on a previously acquired site to the North of Phnom Penh whose objective is to provide several thousand Cambodians with future job training and a regular income in the sectors of agriculture, tourism, industry, and trade. In future, the proceeds are intended to cover the operating costs of the innovative pilot school, which is also part of the cluster and provides education to nearly 1,000 children (from preschool to senior high school).",Publish Date：Dec-22-2022,Closing Date：Jan-21-2023,"Contact Information HR Department    recruitment@smilinggecko-cambodia.org  Srae Sar village, Tbaeng Khpos commune, Samakki Meanchey district, Kompong Chhnang province, Cambodia.

In addition to expanding our business throughout Cambodia, we are expanding our business to overseas regions by diversifying our product lineup, including the T1c for eco-friendly cargo transportation and eco-friendly bikes. In particular, the T1 provides a mileage of more than 100km and is an eco-friendly vehicle that does not have the inconvenience of long charging times by adopting a battery exchange method instead. ONiON has gained popularity in the local market by reducing maintenance costs of our E Tuk-Tuk’s by about 40% of the normal internal combustion vehicles because there is no need of frequent replacement of parts and high oil price.

In 2000, the Bank was          separated from the direct management of the National Bank of Cambodia (""the Central Bank"") in order to transform its permanent identity into a state-owned commercial bank in Cambodia with the features of a Public Economic Enterprise and with the intention of conducting autonomous business              operations. 

In January 2001, the Bank obtained its banking license from the Central Bank to operate as a commercial bank in the Kingdom of Cambodia for a period of      three years starting from 4 January 2001.

On 8 January 2004, the Bank obtained its 2nd banking license from the Central Bank for a period of three years starting    from that date. The Bank now holds a commercial banking license, which was renewed for an indefinite period, on 21 December 2006

","FTB is Cambodia's first and foremost bank. It is a private commercial bank and has been providing customers with safe and reliable banking services for 40 years. 

The Bank was created following Sub-decree No. 1213 dated 10 October 1979 under the former regime of the State of Cambodia. In 2000, the Bank was          separated from the direct management of the National Bank of Cambodia (""the Central Bank"") in order to transform its permanent identity into a state-owned commercial bank in Cambodia with the features of a Public Economic Enterprise and with the intention of conducting autonomous business              operations. 

In January 2001, the Bank obtained its banking license from the Central Bank to operate as a commercial bank in the Kingdom of Cambodia for a period of      three years starting from 4 January 2001. This was the first license granted to enable the Bank to operate as a separate legal entity independent from the Central Bank's direct management. On 8 January 2004, the Bank obtained its 2nd banking license from the Central Bank for a period of three years starting    from that date. The Bank now holds a commercial banking license, which was renewed for an indefinite period, on 21 December 2006

On 31 December 2002, the Ministry of Economy and Finance (""MEF"") announced, through a Statement of Intent, the privatisation of the Bank as part of the   reform of the financial sector of the Royal Government of Cambodia. On 28 October 2005 the shareholders of the Bank, represented by the Privatisation   Committee, entered into a sales agreement with Canadia Bank and ING Holding Company. The Central Bank sold its 20% shareholding in the Bank and MEF   reduced its 80% shareholding to 10%. In 2009, in accordance with the recommendation of the Central Bank, Canadia Bank reduced its shares from 48% to  15.22% and 2 new private shareholders having respectively a share of 15.39%, entered the capital of FTB.

","About Smiling Gecko Cambodia:
In 2014, Smiling Gecko Cambodia (SGC) was officially registered as a local NGO in Cambodia. SGC is legally independent of Smiling Gecko Switzerland. Following its mission of «Cambodians help Cambodians», the organization provides direct aid to disadvantaged people in the country, supporting local job initiatives and promoting self-help among the rural population. Apart from providing direct aid and supporting other NGOs, Smiling Gecko, thus, focuses on fighting the causes of poverty and helping people to help themselves. To this end, SGC launched a project on a previously acquired site to the North of Phnom Penh whose objective is to provide several thousand Cambodians with future job training and a regular income in the sectors of agriculture, tourism, industry, and trade. In future, the proceeds are intended to cover the operating costs of the innovative pilot school, which is also part of the cluster and provides education to nearly 1,000 children (from preschool to senior high school).",Publish Date：Dec-27-2022,Closing Date：Jan-26-2023,"Contact Information HR Department    recruitment@smilinggecko-cambodia.org  Srae Sar village, Tbaeng Khpos commune, Samakki Meanchey district, Kompong Chhnang province, Cambodia.
