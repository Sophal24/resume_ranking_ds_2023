Naturally, these are the very essence which Tube coffee strives to be. We aim to bring fast, affordable, and quality services to Cambodia just like our underground counterpart, but in a coffee way. As synonymous as the tube is with London, Tube coffee aims to be the same in Cambodia, simply by being a Khmer brand created in Cambodia and made by Cambodians to compete with foreign brands.

Apart from providing direct aid and supporting other NGOs, Smiling Gecko, thus, focuses on fighting the causes of poverty and helping people to help themselves. To this end, SGC launched a project on a previously acquired site to the North of Phnom Penh whose objective is to provide several thousand Cambodians with future job training and a regular income in the sectors of agriculture, tourism, industry, and trade. In future, the proceeds are intended to cover the operating costs of the innovative pilot school, which is also part of the cluster and provides education to nearly 1,000 children (from preschool to senior high school).",Publish Date：Sep-16-2023,Closing Date：Oct-16-2023,"Contact Information HR Department    recruitment@smilinggecko-cambodia.org Kampong Chhnang  Srae Sar village, Tbaeng Khpos commune, Samakki Meanchey district, Kompong Chhnang province, Cambodia.
