Starting as a vehicle ride-hailing platform company under the name TADA, we have a business model that increases the application of blockchain technology through each new service we build.ONiON Mobility, a subsidiary of MVL, provides electric vehicles and related infrastructure mainly in Cambodia. TADA, another subsidiary, provides ride-hailing services mainly in Singapore, Cambodia and Vietnam and is building a mobility ecosystem by improving the profit structure of drivers through a new model that is completely different from existing companies.ONiON Mobility is actively conducting business in Cambodia by launching the T1, an eco-friendly version of the three-wheeled passenger vehicle “Tuk-Tuk”. We have established an EV factory to mass-produce our T1’s, and are operating electric vehicle charging stations all over the city of Phnom Penh. In addition to expanding our business throughout Cambodia, we are expanding our business to overseas regions by diversifying our product lineup, including the T1c for eco-friendly cargo transportation and eco-friendly bikes. In particular, the T1 provides a mileage of more than 100km and is an eco-friendly vehicle that does not have the inconvenience of long charging times by adopting a battery exchange method instead. ONiON has gained popularity in the local market by reducing maintenance costs of our E Tuk-Tuk’s by about 40% of the normal internal combustion vehicles because there is no need of frequent replacement of parts and high oil price. In addition, ONiON Mobility plans to collect and utilize all data generated from vehicles and stations for efficient operation and management at the MVL group level as well as to share the benefits to all the participants in the ecosystem created by MVL.",Publish Date：Aug-29-2022,Closing Date：Sep-23-2022,"Contact Information HR  010 656 242 sokhim.pek@onionev.com Phnom Penh HQ: , #93B, St590, Vllage13, Sangkat Boeng kok, Toul Kork, Phnom Penh, Cambodia. 010 656 242"

TADA, another subsidiary, provides ride-hailing services mainly in Singapore, Cambodia and Vietnam and is building a mobility ecosystem by improving the profit structure of drivers through a new model that is completely different from existing companies.ONiON Mobility is actively conducting business in Cambodia by launching the T1, an eco-friendly version of the three-wheeled passenger vehicle “Tuk-Tuk”. We have established an EV factory to mass-produce our T1’s, and are operating electric vehicle charging stations all over the city of Phnom Penh. In addition to expanding our business throughout Cambodia, we are expanding our business to overseas regions by diversifying our product lineup, including the T1c for eco-friendly cargo transportation and eco-friendly bikes. In particular, the T1 provides a mileage of more than 100km and is an eco-friendly vehicle that does not have the inconvenience of long charging times by adopting a battery exchange method instead. ONiON has gained popularity in the local market by reducing maintenance costs of our E Tuk-Tuk’s by about 40% of the normal internal combustion vehicles because there is no need of frequent replacement of parts and high oil price. In addition, ONiON Mobility plans to collect and utilize all data generated from vehicles and stations for efficient operation and management at the MVL group level as well as to share the benefits to all the participants in the ecosystem created by MVL.",Publish Date：Aug-30-2022,Closing Date：Sep-29-2022,"Contact Information HR  010 656 242 sokhim.pek@onionev.com Phnom Penh HQ: , #93B, St590, Vllage13, Sangkat Boeng kok, Toul Kork, Phnom Penh, Cambodia. 010 656 242"

TADA, another subsidiary, provides ride-hailing services mainly in Singapore, Cambodia and Vietnam and is building a mobility ecosystem by improving the profit structure of drivers through a new model that is completely different from existing companies.ONiON Mobility is actively conducting business in Cambodia by launching the T1, an eco-friendly version of the three-wheeled passenger vehicle “Tuk-Tuk”. We have established an EV factory to mass-produce our T1’s, and are operating electric vehicle charging stations all over the city of Phnom Penh. In addition to expanding our business throughout Cambodia, we are expanding our business to overseas regions by diversifying our product lineup, including the T1c for eco-friendly cargo transportation and eco-friendly bikes. In particular, the T1 provides a mileage of more than 100km and is an eco-friendly vehicle that does not have the inconvenience of long charging times by adopting a battery exchange method instead. ONiON has gained popularity in the local market by reducing maintenance costs of our E Tuk-Tuk’s by about 40% of the normal internal combustion vehicles because there is no need of frequent replacement of parts and high oil price.

It is a private commercial bank and has been providing customers with safe and reliable banking services for 40 years. 

The Bank was created following Sub-decree No. 1213 dated 10 October 1979 under the former regime of the State of Cambodia. In 2000, the Bank was          separated from the direct management of the National Bank of Cambodia (""the Central Bank"") in order to transform its permanent identity into a state-owned commercial bank in Cambodia with the features of a Public Economic Enterprise and with the intention of conducting autonomous business              operations. 

In January 2001, the Bank obtained its banking license from the Central Bank to operate as a commercial bank in the Kingdom of Cambodia for a period of      three years starting from 4 January 2001. This was the first license granted to enable the Bank to operate as a separate legal entity independent from the Central Bank's direct management. On 8 January 2004, the Bank obtained its 2nd banking license from the Central Bank for a period of three years starting    from that date. The Bank now holds a commercial banking license, which was renewed for an indefinite period, on 21 December 2006

On 31 December 2002, the Ministry of Economy and Finance (""MEF"") announced, through a Statement of Intent, the privatisation of the Bank as part of the   reform of the financial sector of the Royal Government of Cambodia. On 28 October 2005 the shareholders of the Bank, represented by the Privatisation   Committee, entered into a sales agreement with Canadia Bank and ING Holding Company. The Central Bank sold its 20% shareholding in the Bank and MEF   reduced its 80% shareholding to 10%. In 2009, in accordance with the recommendation of the Central Bank, Canadia Bank reduced its shares from 48% to  15.22% and 2 new private shareholders having respectively a share of 15.39%, entered the capital of FTB.

","FTB is Cambodia's first and foremost bank. It is a private commercial bank and has been providing customers with safe and reliable banking services for 40 years. 

The Bank was created following Sub-decree No. 1213 dated 10 October 1979 under the former regime of the State of Cambodia. In 2000, the Bank was          separated from the direct management of the National Bank of Cambodia (""the Central Bank"") in order to transform its permanent identity into a state-owned commercial bank in Cambodia with the features of a Public Economic Enterprise and with the intention of conducting autonomous business              operations. 

In January 2001, the Bank obtained its banking license from the Central Bank to operate as a commercial bank in the Kingdom of Cambodia for a period of      three years starting from 4 January 2001. This was the first license granted to enable the Bank to operate as a separate legal entity independent from the Central Bank's direct management. On 8 January 2004, the Bank obtained its 2nd banking license from the Central Bank for a period of three years starting    from that date. The Bank now holds a commercial banking license, which was renewed for an indefinite period, on 21 December 2006

On 31 December 2002, the Ministry of Economy and Finance (""MEF"") announced, through a Statement of Intent, the privatisation of the Bank as part of the   reform of the financial sector of the Royal Government of Cambodia. On 28 October 2005 the shareholders of the Bank, represented by the Privatisation   Committee, entered into a sales agreement with Canadia Bank and ING Holding Company. The Central Bank sold its 20% shareholding in the Bank and MEF   reduced its 80% shareholding to 10%. In 2009, in accordance with the recommendation of the Central Bank, Canadia Bank reduced its shares from 48% to  15.22% and 2 new private shareholders having respectively a share of 15.39%, entered the capital of FTB.
