In this state, the company has to have two vital characteristic in order to prevail. Confidence and courage. Today we have developed a third trait in the company’s philosophy and that is Vision. We have confidence in our people, our partners and the free market. We have full confidence in the development of the country as long as it will take. Our confidence is shown in our eagerness to invest in long term projects and infrastructures. We do not like to go into short term projects because it will distract us from our long term goals. We invest in our people through education and knowledge. At the same time we have confidence in the Cambodian people to shape a progressive society. Our customers are also our long term business partners for without their continued support we will not grow and prosper. Without courage we will not be where we are today. We are proud we possess the courage to invest in large projects where others may shy away because it’s too risky. It’s not because we love to take risk but we have confidence in the people and country. We manage our risk with detailed analysis. It takes courage to deal in areas outside our core business. But we take it as a learning experience. We will not hesitate to draw in the best of talents both local and foreign to achieve our goals. And we go about it professionally and with honesty. We do not plan our business based on a five year plan, our vision is far longer. We forecast our business by the decades in the future because without doing so we might not be prepared for change. Just like in the glorious Angkorian era, the Angkor Wat was not build in a few years but it took generations of leaders with great vision over centuries to create something that last for ages.

It is a private commercial bank and has been providing customers with safe and reliable banking services for 40 years. 

The Bank was created following Sub-decree No. 1213 dated 10 October 1979 under the former regime of the State of Cambodia. In 2000, the Bank was          separated from the direct management of the National Bank of Cambodia (""the Central Bank"") in order to transform its permanent identity into a state-owned commercial bank in Cambodia with the features of a Public Economic Enterprise and with the intention of conducting autonomous business              operations. 

In January 2001, the Bank obtained its banking license from the Central Bank to operate as a commercial bank in the Kingdom of Cambodia for a period of      three years starting from 4 January 2001. This was the first license granted to enable the Bank to operate as a separate legal entity independent from the Central Bank's direct management. On 8 January 2004, the Bank obtained its 2nd banking license from the Central Bank for a period of three years starting    from that date. The Bank now holds a commercial banking license, which was renewed for an indefinite period, on 21 December 2006

On 31 December 2002, the Ministry of Economy and Finance (""MEF"") announced, through a Statement of Intent, the privatisation of the Bank as part of the   reform of the financial sector of the Royal Government of Cambodia. On 28 October 2005 the shareholders of the Bank, represented by the Privatisation   Committee, entered into a sales agreement with Canadia Bank and ING Holding Company. The Central Bank sold its 20% shareholding in the Bank and MEF   reduced its 80% shareholding to 10%. In 2009, in accordance with the recommendation of the Central Bank, Canadia Bank reduced its shares from 48% to  15.22% and 2 new private shareholders having respectively a share of 15.39%, entered the capital of FTB.

Hence, WON Majestic was incorporated in 2017 with a solid backing of qualified management team from Malaysia, Singapore and China who have over 20 years of real estate management experience.

It is not easy to make its presence felt in the international map. The company has to face many cultural differences as well as different and unfamiliar local Government policies. But with true grit and perseverance, WON Majestic has weathered all storm. In fact, the company charted new milestones in 2018 by being one of the few foreign developers to obtain Housing Development Permit in Cambodia. Since then, success breeds success. In 2019, WON Majestic was granted Qualified Investment Project Status from Council for the Development of Cambodia (CDC).

As the world was hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, real estate developers need to adapt to the new normal and consumer trend. WON Majestic has taken initiatives to comply with the strict Government’s Standard Operating Procedure for a safe and clean development.
There will be many challenges ahead for the real estate market but WON Majestic is positive that its future is promising. After all, we have proven to have “WON” against the odds.
