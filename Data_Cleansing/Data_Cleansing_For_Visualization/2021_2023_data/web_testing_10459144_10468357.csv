","TUBE COFFEE created by 3 Cambodian Shareholders. Tube is inspired by London’s metro system, the underground TUBE, for which its fast speed, reliable quality, and affordability are world-renowned. Naturally, these are the very essence which Tube coffee strives to be. We aim to bring fast, affordable, and quality services to Cambodia just like our underground counterpart, but in a coffee way. As synonymous as the tube is with London, Tube coffee aims to be the same in Cambodia, simply by being a Khmer brand created in Cambodia and made by Cambodians to compete with foreign brands. By using yellow, we hope to present to the world the warmth, freshness, happiness, optimism, and positivity of the Khmer culture. So, hop aboard and enjoy a smooth ride on the Khmer tube.

It is a private commercial bank and has been providing customers with safe and reliable banking services for 40 years. 

The Bank was created following Sub-decree No. 1213 dated 10 October 1979 under the former regime of the State of Cambodia. In 2000, the Bank was          separated from the direct management of the National Bank of Cambodia (""the Central Bank"") in order to transform its permanent identity into a state-owned commercial bank in Cambodia with the features of a Public Economic Enterprise and with the intention of conducting autonomous business              operations. 

In January 2001, the Bank obtained its banking license from the Central Bank to operate as a commercial bank in the Kingdom of Cambodia for a period of      three years starting from 4 January 2001. This was the first license granted to enable the Bank to operate as a separate legal entity independent from the Central Bank's direct management. On 8 January 2004, the Bank obtained its 2nd banking license from the Central Bank for a period of three years starting    from that date. The Bank now holds a commercial banking license, which was renewed for an indefinite period, on 21 December 2006

On 31 December 2002, the Ministry of Economy and Finance (""MEF"") announced, through a Statement of Intent, the privatisation of the Bank as part of the   reform of the financial sector of the Royal Government of Cambodia. On 28 October 2005 the shareholders of the Bank, represented by the Privatisation   Committee, entered into a sales agreement with Canadia Bank and ING Holding Company. The Central Bank sold its 20% shareholding in the Bank and MEF   reduced its 80% shareholding to 10%. In 2009, in accordance with the recommendation of the Central Bank, Canadia Bank reduced its shares from 48% to  15.22% and 2 new private shareholders having respectively a share of 15.39%, entered the capital of FTB.

Address: Unit B8, #225, Street 45, Sangkat Sras Chork, Khan Daun Penh, Phnom Penh (12201), kingdom of Cambodia","OYIKA is a Singapore venture-funded company which started working on a battery share concept for e-motorbikes in 2018. In 2019, OYIKA arrived in Cambodia and launched a service in the capital of Phnom Penh. The company is headed by its President, Carl Wong, and it plans to expand throughout the Kingdom and in SEA.

OYIKA offers a battery share concept and allows an e-motorbike rider to swap their leased depleted battery for a fully charged one at a swap station. So instead of topping up petrol at a kiosk when the vehicle runs out of fuel, the rider is now topping up on stored power. Battery share, therefore, replaces petrol and thus it is also cheaper.
OYIKA claims its battery share solution solves the issues of driver anxiety, battery degradation and upfront capital costs which also act as barriers to the adoption of electric vehicles.

        ","** Hotel Receptionist Job Description:
Greeting and ensuring that guests are accommodated are the primary roles of a hotel receptionist, often referred to as a hotel front desk agent or clerk. The hotel receptionist is typically the first hotel employee guests encounter when they arrive at a hotel, so easy conversationalists with a welcoming, courteous manner will help set the right tone in this role. They’re also tasked with managing reservations and checking out guests. Receptionists work for both large hotel chains or smaller, private facilities. Because hotels serve guests at all hours, receptionists may need to work weekend and holiday shifts during any range of the establishment’s operating hours. Often an entry level position, hotel receptionists report to the front office or hotel manager. Experience as a receptionist can kick start a career in a variety of roles within the hospitality industry.

** Hotel Receptionist Duties and Responsibilities:
* Check-in Guests
Hotel receptionists greet incoming guests and welcome them to the hotel. They confirm reservations, explain hotel amenities, give directions to rooms, and produce room keys. They also arrange for luggage to be brought to rooms upon request.

* Handle Guest Inquiries and Complaints
From providing additional linens to handling complaints about noise or room temperature, hotel receptionists are responsible for accommodating guests during their shifts. They contact necessary personnel, such as managers or housekeeping, to handle specific requests or complaints.

* Answer Phones
Hotel receptionists take all incoming calls at a hotel. They handle phone reservations, confirm previously-made reservations, give directions to the hotel and answer any questions customers have about the lodgings.

* Process Payments
When a guest’s stay is over, hotel receptionists handle check-outs. At this time, they will issue payments such as additional room charges and process debit or credit cards to pay for room fees.
","** Hotel Receptionist Skills:
- Strong interpersonal, verbal communication, and customer service skills are the top abilities needed for hotel receptionists. They should be patient and display above-average organizational skills. The abilities to deal effectively with crises and work with a diverse population are essential for this position. The following skills are commonly sought after by employers:

- Administration – while some on-the-job training will be provided, receptionists need a level of comfort in computer, bookkeeping, phone, and other administrative skills.

- Math skills – calculating guest charges and settling room payments as well as processing invoices and completing payment transactions require basic math skills from receptionists.

- Attention to detail – in order to maintain a functioning front desk, receptions are highly organized and detail-oriented.

- Multitasking – hotel receptionists often juggle many requests at a time and are good at prioritizing tasks without missing a beat.

- Customer service – as the first in line to respond to guest complaints and special requests, hotel receptionists excel at dealing with people in a professional, calm manner. They are natural listeners who understand the importance of verbal and non-verbal communication.
