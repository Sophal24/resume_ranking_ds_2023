 ","GBS is a one-stop company for coffee and tea solutions, which is reflected in our logo. Founded in 2016, GBS mission was to foster Cambodian coffee industry through the 3 pillars – product, service and knowledge.

Acknowledging the complication of establishing or expanding a coffee business, thanks to a wide range of product offer, GBS focuses on providing a solution-based product package according to the customers’ individual request and business demand.
We offer complementary training as our barista demonstrates their skill and know-how to assist customer for the challenges in the coffee business environment. We also offer advanced barista and latte art classes for those who would like to further develop their skills.
We take pride in our technical service, as we receive many positive feedbacks since our day one in business.

In 2018, GBS established B-Hub Barista Training Center to offer high quality barista training with tools and resources that allow student to dive deeper into a coffee world.
