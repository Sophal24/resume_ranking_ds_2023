","About Smiling Gecko Cambodia:
In 2014, Smiling Gecko Cambodia (SGC) was officially registered as a local NGO in Cambodia. SGC is legally independent of Smiling Gecko Switzerland. Following its mission of «Cambodians help Cambodians», the organization provides direct aid to disadvantaged people in the country, supporting local job initiatives and promoting self-help among the rural population. Apart from providing direct aid and supporting other NGOs, Smiling Gecko, thus, focuses on fighting the causes of poverty and helping people to help themselves. To this end, SGC launched a project on a previously acquired site to the North of Phnom Penh whose objective is to provide several thousand Cambodians with future job training and a regular income in the sectors of agriculture, tourism, industry, and trade. In future, the proceeds are intended to cover the operating costs of the innovative pilot school, which is also part of the cluster and provides education to nearly 1,000 children (from preschool to senior high school).",Publish Date：Nov-11-2022,Closing Date：Dec-11-2022,"Contact Information HR Department    recruitment@smilinggecko-cambodia.org  Srae Sar village, Tbaeng Khpos commune, Samakki Meanchey district, Kompong Chhnang province, Cambodia.

Starting as a vehicle ride-hailing platform company under the name TADA, we have a business model that increases the application of blockchain technology through each new service we build.ONiON Mobility, a subsidiary of MVL, provides electric vehicles and related infrastructure mainly in Cambodia. TADA, another subsidiary, provides ride-hailing services mainly in Singapore, Cambodia and Vietnam and is building a mobility ecosystem by improving the profit structure of drivers through a new model that is completely different from existing companies.ONiON Mobility is actively conducting business in Cambodia by launching the T1, an eco-friendly version of the three-wheeled passenger vehicle “Tuk-Tuk”. We have established an EV factory to mass-produce our T1’s, and are operating electric vehicle charging stations all over the city of Phnom Penh. In addition to expanding our business throughout Cambodia, we are expanding our business to overseas regions by diversifying our product lineup, including the T1c for eco-friendly cargo transportation and eco-friendly bikes. In particular, the T1 provides a mileage of more than 100km and is an eco-friendly vehicle that does not have the inconvenience of long charging times by adopting a battery exchange method instead. ONiON has gained popularity in the local market by reducing maintenance costs of our E Tuk-Tuk’s by about 40% of the normal internal combustion vehicles because there is no need of frequent replacement of parts and high oil price. In addition, ONiON Mobility plans to collect and utilize all data generated from vehicles and stations for efficient operation and management at the MVL group level as well as to share the benefits to all the participants in the ecosystem created by MVL.",Publish Date：Nov-14-2022,Closing Date：Dec-14-2022,"Contact Information HR  010 656 242 sokhim.pek@onionev.com Phnom Penh HQ: , #93B, St590, Vllage13, Sangkat Boeng kok, Toul Kork, Phnom Penh, Cambodia. 010 656 242"
