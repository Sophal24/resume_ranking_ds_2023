","Formally known as American Academy of Language and Art (AALA), ELT was founded by US entrepreneurs who strongly believed that education was a foundation in rebuilding the lives of Cambodian civilians. EESS is part of the ELT institution which offers many classes ranging from grades one to twelve. Students are given the opportunity to undertake studies in both Khmer and English which has been inspired by the learning and teaching standards of America. The Cambodian Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport recognizes the school’s commitment to education and has granted the rights for EESS to issue diplomas after meeting the credit requirements.

Due to students’ willingness and persistency in rebuilding their lives through education, the management team of ELT institution was able to introduce Cambodian International University in 2010. CamIU was established with the hope of providing students with Advanced Diploma, Intensive Diploma, Associate Degree, Bachelor’s Degree and Master Degrees that are widely recognized by the Cambodian Government. 

Over the years, ELT institution has made tremendous progress. In the beginning of 2010, there were 375 registered staff members and 5850 enrolled students. The prestigious reputation of ELT Group continues to grow and will do so through the strong leadership of its management team.

","As Cambodia’s longest-serving and only 100% locally owned mobile communications company, Cellcard has more than 24 years of service to the Kingdom maintaining a customer base of more than 4 million subscribers.

Cellcard launched in 1997 in a joint venture with Millicom International Cellular providing its customers with the first prepaid service with scratchcards.

What followed for Cellcard was a number of firsts in the market such as introducing SMS, Value-Added Services, a dedicated Loyalty program, roaming services and a credit sharing platform.

Cellcard is Cambodia’s most-awarded mobile network having achieved more than 30 industry awards for network excellence including an impressive six consecutive Ookla Speedtest awards and a number of category wins from Opensignal including Best Games Experience in February 2020.

It’s most recent market firsts include the Cellcard Network Guarantee launched in 2017 reimbursing any customer who experiences a dropped call, the award-winning App-based Super Data Race held each year since 2017 and its move to lead the esports agenda in 2018 followed in 2019 with Cambodia’s first virtual gamer platform PlayGame and the first tailormade gamer data plan PlayGame Unlimited.

In February 2021, Cellcard revealed its latest innovation, the Pouk Mak chat app, the world’s first major Khmer languaged messaging App.

A major focus for Cellcard now is its evolution to 5G for consumers and enterprise, including Smart City applications across Fintech and web security, data privacy, public safety and security, environment protection, education, healthcare and e-government.

In terms of 5G network readiness, Cellcard has conducted numerous live tests on its stand-alone site reaching speeds of 1.8 gigabytes per second. These are Cambodia’s first and only tests conducted on a real end-to-end with 5G radio to a 5G core network able to accommodate network slicing for dedicated use cases.

EESS is part of the ELT institution which offers many classes ranging from grades one to twelve. Students are given the opportunity to undertake studies in both Khmer and English which has been inspired by the learning and teaching standards of America. The Cambodian Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport recognizes the school’s commitment to education and has granted the rights for EESS to issue diplomas after meeting the credit requirements.

Due to students’ willingness and persistency in rebuilding their lives through education, the management team of ELT institution was able to introduce Cambodian International University in 2010. CamIU was established with the hope of providing students with Advanced Diploma, Intensive Diploma, Associate Degree, Bachelor’s Degree and Master Degrees that are widely recognized by the Cambodian Government. 

Over the years, ELT institution has made tremendous progress. In the beginning of 2010, there were 375 registered staff members and 5850 enrolled students. The prestigious reputation of ELT Group continues to grow and will do so through the strong leadership of its management team.

        ",#NAME?,#NAME?,"As Cambodia’s longest-serving and only 100% locally owned mobile communications company, Cellcard has more than 24 years of service to the Kingdom maintaining a customer base of more than 4 million subscribers.

Cellcard launched in 1997 in a joint venture with Millicom International Cellular providing its customers with the first prepaid service with scratchcards.

What followed for Cellcard was a number of firsts in the market such as introducing SMS, Value-Added Services, a dedicated Loyalty program, roaming services and a credit sharing platform.

Cellcard is Cambodia’s most-awarded mobile network having achieved more than 30 industry awards for network excellence including an impressive six consecutive Ookla Speedtest awards and a number of category wins from Opensignal including Best Games Experience in February 2020.

It’s most recent market firsts include the Cellcard Network Guarantee launched in 2017 reimbursing any customer who experiences a dropped call, the award-winning App-based Super Data Race held each year since 2017 and its move to lead the esports agenda in 2018 followed in 2019 with Cambodia’s first virtual gamer platform PlayGame and the first tailormade gamer data plan PlayGame Unlimited.

In February 2021, Cellcard revealed its latest innovation, the Pouk Mak chat app, the world’s first major Khmer languaged messaging App.

A major focus for Cellcard now is its evolution to 5G for consumers and enterprise, including Smart City applications across Fintech and web security, data privacy, public safety and security, environment protection, education, healthcare and e-government.

In terms of 5G network readiness, Cellcard has conducted numerous live tests on its stand-alone site reaching speeds of 1.8 gigabytes per second. These are Cambodia’s first and only tests conducted on a real end-to-end with 5G radio to a 5G core network able to accommodate network slicing for dedicated use cases.

It’s a place that breathes in time with nature, built from local materials, by local hands, and infused with local art and soul. An evolved tropical getaway with a pristine private beach, spacious wooden villas, heavenly spa sanctuaries and a preserved coral reef, Song Saa Private Island lets you detach from the world and tune into simple luxuries.

Built with reclaimed timber and materials from the mainland, the resort’s design and architecture reiterates our commitment to sustainability. Each villa is a private sanctuary, a refined blend of thatched roofs, linen-draped canopy beds, up-cycled décor and repurposed furniture. Discarded oil drums find new life as lamps. Driftwood serves as a table or bench.

Those patients or families who can afford to make small contribution are asked to do so. Over 120,000 Cambodian children are cared for at AHC every year. Our hospital also supports greater Cambodian health care self-sufficiency through its Medical Education Center (MEC). AHC was officially recognized as a teaching hospital by the government of Cambodia in 2005. The MEC provides high quality training and education to hundreds of Cambodian nurses and doctors each year.
