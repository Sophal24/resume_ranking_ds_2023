Oligo Trading Co., Ltd. is a distribution company and also a mother company of Megabelle Beauty Center which was founded by H.E. Mrs. Keo Vong Siek since 2009.

As a normal lady who always be beauty conscious, in 2005 Mrs. Vongsiek had been looking high quality cosmetic products for her daily skin care from local and abroad including Europe and USA. Getting good result from such products, Mrs. Vongsiek initiated an idea of sharing this secret to other women in Cambodia.

In 2006, Mrs. Vorngsiek started operating beauty center under the name of Olibelle Beauty Center where located at BS department store, Monivong Blvd.Due to business grew rapidly, she decided to buy Oligo Spa at Sorya Shopping Center in 2008 to expand the business, products range and beauty services to meet the need of customers. Within the same year we opened Oligodermie Beauty Center where located at Sovanna Shopping Mall and Megabelle Beauty Shop, located at Paragon Shopping Mall. At the end of year 2008, Mrs. Vorngsiek has decided to open a central beauty center called Megabelle Beauty Center where located in Kampuchea Krom Blvd.

 As we offer high quality products and services to customers, we have gained a complete trust to be beauty solution provider in the country. Our customers were increasing every year so we have expanded many branches of professional beauty center nationwide. In order to response to demand increase, we decided to develop our business in a manner of Distribution Company. In 2009, Oligo Trading was established to import and supply many types of cosmetic products to all of our own beauty center, counter and other stores ranging from very affordable skin care, skin whitening to the top treatment range.

 Currently, Oligo head office is located in No.117Eo, Monivong Blvd. and has 8 own Megabelle beauty centers, 10 Oligodermie Beauty Centers, more than 10 Oligo counters (targeting to open 10",Publish Date：Dec-24-2013,Closing Date：Jan-23-2014,"Contact Information Channmony  016 777 286 / 013 777 286 / 086 777 286 #89-91E0, Kampuchea Krom Blvd, Sangkat Monorom, Khan 7Makara Phnom Penh, Cambodia.
