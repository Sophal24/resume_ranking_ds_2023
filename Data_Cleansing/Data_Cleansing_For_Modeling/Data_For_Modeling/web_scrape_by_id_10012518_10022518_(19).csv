The image of “a Sharetea drink in your hand” has imprinted in our customers’ minds which leads Sharetea Pearl Milk Tea to its success internationally.

The chairman of Lian-Fa International Sharetea, Cheng Kai-lung, has always seen himself as a leader in tea-drinking sector. Share Tea is the only beverage industry franchise corporation which is recognized as “Taiwan Good Chain Store” by Ministry of Economic Affairs, Taiwan for 6 consecutive years.
