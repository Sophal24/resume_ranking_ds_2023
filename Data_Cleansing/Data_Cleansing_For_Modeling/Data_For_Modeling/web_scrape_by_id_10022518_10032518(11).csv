Cellcard launched in 1997 in a joint venture with Millicom International Cellular providing its customers with the first prepaid service with scratchcards.

What followed for Cellcard was a number of firsts in the market such as introducing SMS, Value-Added Services, a dedicated Loyalty program, roaming services and a credit sharing platform.

Cellcard is Cambodia’s most-awarded mobile network having achieved more than 30 industry awards for network excellence including an impressive six consecutive Ookla Speedtest awards and a number of category wins from Opensignal including Best Games Experience in February 2020.

It’s most recent market firsts include the Cellcard Network Guarantee launched in 2017 reimbursing any customer who experiences a dropped call, the award-winning App-based Super Data Race held each year since 2017 and its move to lead the esports agenda in 2018 followed in 2019 with Cambodia’s first virtual gamer platform PlayGame and the first tailormade gamer data plan PlayGame Unlimited.

In February 2021, Cellcard revealed its latest innovation, the Pouk Mak chat app, the world’s first major Khmer languaged messaging App.

A major focus for Cellcard now is its evolution to 5G for consumers and enterprise, including Smart City applications across Fintech and web security, data privacy, public safety and security, environment protection, education, healthcare and e-government.

In terms of 5G network readiness, Cellcard has conducted numerous live tests on its stand-alone site reaching speeds of 1.8 gigabytes per second. These are Cambodia’s first and only tests conducted on a real end-to-end with 5G radio to a 5G core network able to accommodate network slicing for dedicated use cases.

Cellcard launched in 1997 in a joint venture with Millicom International Cellular providing its customers with the first prepaid service with scratchcards.

What followed for Cellcard was a number of firsts in the market such as introducing SMS, Value-Added Services, a dedicated Loyalty program, roaming services and a credit sharing platform.

Cellcard is Cambodia’s most-awarded mobile network having achieved more than 30 industry awards for network excellence including an impressive six consecutive Ookla Speedtest awards and a number of category wins from Opensignal including Best Games Experience in February 2020.

It’s most recent market firsts include the Cellcard Network Guarantee launched in 2017 reimbursing any customer who experiences a dropped call, the award-winning App-based Super Data Race held each year since 2017 and its move to lead the esports agenda in 2018 followed in 2019 with Cambodia’s first virtual gamer platform PlayGame and the first tailormade gamer data plan PlayGame Unlimited.

In February 2021, Cellcard revealed its latest innovation, the Pouk Mak chat app, the world’s first major Khmer languaged messaging App.

A major focus for Cellcard now is its evolution to 5G for consumers and enterprise, including Smart City applications across Fintech and web security, data privacy, public safety and security, environment protection, education, healthcare and e-government.

In terms of 5G network readiness, Cellcard has conducted numerous live tests on its stand-alone site reaching speeds of 1.8 gigabytes per second. These are Cambodia’s first and only tests conducted on a real end-to-end with 5G radio to a 5G core network able to accommodate network slicing for dedicated use cases.

","Angkor Hospital for Children (AHC) is a Pediatric Hospital providing free treatment and care to the children in the Siem Reap area and Cambodia. On average 450 children and their families arrive at the hospital seeking care each day. Since opening in 1999, there have been more than 1 million visits to AHC by Cambodian children. AHC is an official Teaching Hospital and has taught more than 3,500 healthcare professionals from Cambodia. According to the latest statistics, 1 of every 20 children in Cambodia dies before his or her 5th birthday, often from treatable and/or preventable illness. Although their standard of living is steadily improving, Cambodians still suffer from endemic poverty. Therefore, AHC provides outpatient, inpatient, intensive, surgical, and HIV care, as well as other services, free of charge. Those patients or families who can afford to make small contribution are asked to do so. Over 120,000 Cambodian children are cared for at AHC every year. Our hospital also supports greater Cambodian health care self-sufficiency through its Medical Education Center (MEC). AHC was officially recognized as a teaching hospital by the government of Cambodia in 2005. The MEC provides high quality training and education to hundreds of Cambodian nurses and doctors each year. In addition, AHC serves as a training site for the World Health Organization’s Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses Program (IMCI).

","Share Tea Dining Business Corporate was founded in 1992 by Mr. Cheng Kai-Lung and we started off our business with to-go black tea and pearl milk tea drinks. With great comments and feedback from our customers Share Tea was known as good tea. Since then, we have expanded our branches all over the world and we have had great success as part of the tea-drinking sector.

In 1992, the very first shop of Share Tea opened in Taipei City; three years later, Share Tea Corporation was founded; in 1999, the franchise brand “CUP-BON” was established in Malaysia successfully; in 2004, the patent T-shaped bag was invented and became a new trend; in 2010, Share Tea first chain store was opened in Hong Kong which is famous for its marvelous cuisines and within a short period of time, 40 chain stores were opened all over Hong Kong and Macao; in 2011, we targeted Chinese markets including Beijing , Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen; also expanded our markets worldwide from Singapore, Malaysia, Philippines, Brunei and Australia to New York and even Dubai. The image of “a Sharetea drink in your hand” has imprinted in our customers’ minds which leads Sharetea Pearl Milk Tea to its success internationally.

The chairman of Lian-Fa International Sharetea, Cheng Kai-lung, has always seen himself as a leader in tea-drinking sector. Share Tea is the only beverage industry franchise corporation which is recognized as “Taiwan Good Chain Store” by Ministry of Economic Affairs, Taiwan for 6 consecutive years. We were the only pearl milk tea at the 2009 Taipei Deaflmpics and the only pearl milk tea brand that represented Taiwanese culture in R.O.C. 100th birthday celebration.

What we see ourselves in the future is to expand our market like a ripple with a new way of thinking which means health + tea drinks = healthy trend, and a new way of marketing which means creation + tea drinks=creative new fashion. Our mission is to introduce the world the most authentic Taiwanese tea-drinking",Publish Date：Apr-04-2014,Closing Date：Invalid date,"Contact Information Ms. Lim Sivly Administration Manager 012 445 665 Phnom Penh, Cambodia  012 445 665"

","Angkor Hospital for Children (AHC) is a Pediatric Hospital providing free treatment and care to the children in the Siem Reap area and Cambodia. On average 450 children and their families arrive at the hospital seeking care each day. Since opening in 1999, there have been more than 1 million visits to AHC by Cambodian children. AHC is an official Teaching Hospital and has taught more than 3,500 healthcare professionals from Cambodia. According to the latest statistics, 1 of every 20 children in Cambodia dies before his or her 5th birthday, often from treatable and/or preventable illness. Although their standard of living is steadily improving, Cambodians still suffer from endemic poverty. Therefore, AHC provides outpatient, inpatient, intensive, surgical, and HIV care, as well as other services, free of charge. Those patients or families who can afford to make small contribution are asked to do so. Over 120,000 Cambodian children are cared for at AHC every year. Our hospital also supports greater Cambodian health care self-sufficiency through its Medical Education Center (MEC). AHC was officially recognized as a teaching hospital by the government of Cambodia in 2005. The MEC provides high quality training and education to hundreds of Cambodian nurses and doctors each year. In addition, AHC serves as a training site for the World Health Organization’s Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses Program (IMCI).

In 1992, the very first shop of Share Tea opened in Taipei City; three years later, Share Tea Corporation was founded; in 1999, the franchise brand “CUP-BON” was established in Malaysia successfully; in 2004, the patent T-shaped bag was invented and became a new trend; in 2010, Share Tea first chain store was opened in Hong Kong which is famous for its marvelous cuisines and within a short period of time, 40 chain stores were opened all over Hong Kong and Macao; in 2011, we targeted Chinese markets including Beijing , Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen; also expanded our markets worldwide from Singapore, Malaysia, Philippines, Brunei and Australia to New York and even Dubai. The image of “a Sharetea drink in your hand” has imprinted in our customers’ minds which leads Sharetea Pearl Milk Tea to its success internationally.

The chairman of Lian-Fa International Sharetea, Cheng Kai-lung, has always seen himself as a leader in tea-drinking sector.

Cellcard launched in 1997 in a joint venture with Millicom International Cellular providing its customers with the first prepaid service with scratchcards.

What followed for Cellcard was a number of firsts in the market such as introducing SMS, Value-Added Services, a dedicated Loyalty program, roaming services and a credit sharing platform.

Cellcard is Cambodia’s most-awarded mobile network having achieved more than 30 industry awards for network excellence including an impressive six consecutive Ookla Speedtest awards and a number of category wins from Opensignal including Best Games Experience in February 2020.

It’s most recent market firsts include the Cellcard Network Guarantee launched in 2017 reimbursing any customer who experiences a dropped call, the award-winning App-based Super Data Race held each year since 2017 and its move to lead the esports agenda in 2018 followed in 2019 with Cambodia’s first virtual gamer platform PlayGame and the first tailormade gamer data plan PlayGame Unlimited.

In February 2021, Cellcard revealed its latest innovation, the Pouk Mak chat app, the world’s first major Khmer languaged messaging App.

A major focus for Cellcard now is its evolution to 5G for consumers and enterprise, including Smart City applications across Fintech and web security, data privacy, public safety and security, environment protection, education, healthcare and e-government.

In terms of 5G network readiness, Cellcard has conducted numerous live tests on its stand-alone site reaching speeds of 1.8 gigabytes per second. These are Cambodia’s first and only tests conducted on a real end-to-end with 5G radio to a 5G core network able to accommodate network slicing for dedicated use cases.

        ",Part time for Full Time Needed ,#NAME?,"Formally known as American Academy of Language and Art (AALA), ELT was founded by US entrepreneurs who strongly believed that education was a foundation in rebuilding the lives of Cambodian civilians. EESS is part of the ELT institution which offers many classes ranging from grades one to twelve. Students are given the opportunity to undertake studies in both Khmer and English which has been inspired by the learning and teaching standards of America. The Cambodian Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport recognizes the school’s commitment to education and has granted the rights for EESS to issue diplomas after meeting the credit requirements.

Due to students’ willingness and persistency in rebuilding their lives through education, the management team of ELT institution was able to introduce Cambodian International University in 2010. CamIU was established with the hope of providing students with Advanced Diploma, Intensive Diploma, Associate Degree, Bachelor’s Degree and Master Degrees that are widely recognized by the Cambodian Government. 

Over the years, ELT institution has made tremendous progress. In the beginning of 2010, there were 375 registered staff members and 5850 enrolled students. The prestigious reputation of ELT Group continues to grow and will do so through the strong leadership of its management team.
