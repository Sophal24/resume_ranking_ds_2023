","     西哈努克港经济特区有限公司是西港特区的开发建设主体。西港特区是为企业走出去实现跨国发展的最佳投资贸易平台，是中国首批国家级境外经贸合作区之一，是首个签订双边政府协定的合作区，也是首个建立双边政府协调机制的合作区。总体规划面积11.13平方公里，首期开发面积5.28平方公里，以纺织服装、五金机械、轻工家电等为主导产业，同时集出口加工区、商贸区、生活区于一体。全部建成后可容纳企业300家，就业人口达8—10万人。
　　西港特区地处柬埔寨王国唯一的国际港口城市——西哈努克市，离西港国际机场3公里, 离西哈努克深水港12公里，连接柬埔寨国内最好的公路——四号国道，离柬首都金边仅210公里，地理位置优越，交通便利。 
　　作为中柬两国间的重要合作项目，西港特区受到了两国领导人及各级政府部门的高度关注，2010年12月13日，两国政府在北京正式签订《中华人民共和国政府和柬埔寨王国政府关于西哈努克港经济特区的协定》，奠定了西港特区的法律地位。2012年6月13日，时任中共中央政治局常委、中央纪委书记贺国强在访问柬埔寨期间与柬埔寨王国首相洪森共同为西港特区揭牌。同时，在双边框架协定下，2012年12月4日，西港特区协调委员会第一次会议在无锡召开，标志双边政府支持推动西港特区发展的长效协调机制正式启动。2014年1月27日，中国商务部部长助理张向晨、柬埔寨发展理事会秘书长索庆达在金边共同主持召开西港特区协调委员会第二次会议，为西港特区的快速发展奠定了良好基础。

　　在两国政府的大力支持下，西港特区发展迅速。目前，西港特区3平方公里区域内已基本实现通路、通电、通水、通讯、排污（五通）和平地（一平）；相应地生产、生活配套设施同步跟进。不仅引入了由柬埔寨发展理事会、商业部、海关、商检、劳工局、西哈努克省政府代表组成的“一站式”行政服务窗口，还引入两家物流清关公司、台湾均辉船务有限公司及柬埔寨加华银行等，为入区企业提供高效、全面的服务；同时，联合无锡商业职业技术学院共同建设西港特区培训中心。培训中心根据入区企业人力资源需求，提供语言培训及技能培训，现已开展了四期培训，成效显著。

　　特区现已引入包括工业、服务行业在内的100家企业入驻，分别来自中国、欧美及日本等国家和地区，81家已生产经营，区内从业人数约12000人。

　　建设中的西港特区以创建一个投资环境优越的国际样板园区，一个充满活力的上市公司，一个生态环境良好的工业化新城镇为战略目标。相信，不久的将来，西港特区必将成为中国境外经贸合作区的成功典范，成为中柬世代友好的象征！
