It’s most recent market firsts include the Cellcard Network Guarantee launched in 2017 reimbursing any customer who experiences a dropped call, the award-winning App-based Super Data Race held each year since 2017 and its move to lead the esports agenda in 2018 followed in 2019 with Cambodia’s first virtual gamer platform PlayGame and the first tailormade gamer data plan PlayGame Unlimited.

In February 2021, Cellcard revealed its latest innovation, the Pouk Mak chat app, the world’s first major Khmer languaged messaging App.

A major focus for Cellcard now is its evolution to 5G for consumers and enterprise, including Smart City applications across Fintech and web security, data privacy, public safety and security, environment protection, education, healthcare and e-government.

In terms of 5G network readiness, Cellcard has conducted numerous live tests on its stand-alone site reaching speeds of 1.8 gigabytes per second. These are Cambodia’s first and only tests conducted on a real end-to-end with 5G radio to a 5G core network able to accommodate network slicing for dedicated use cases.
